## 🚀 Installation & Setup

These instructions assume you have `Node.js`, `npm`, and `Python 3.11+` installed on your machine.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadhgsavageplymouth/JetSetGo.git
cd JetSetGo
```

---

### 2. Set up the Frontend (React Client)

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

- This will install all required packages (React, React Router, Firebase SDK, etc.).

To start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```
- The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`

---

### 3. Set up the Backend (FastAPI Server)

```bash
cd ../server
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install:
> ```bash
> pip install fastapi uvicorn openai pandas numpy faiss-cpu scikit-learn python-dotenv
> ```

---

### 4. Create your `.env` file

In the `server/` directory, create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

This API key is used for fetching visa and travel information dynamically via OpenAI.

---

### 5. Start the Backend Server

From the `server/` directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
- The FastAPI server will now run on `http://localhost:8000/`.
